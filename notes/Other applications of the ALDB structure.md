# Session/state management
## On the desktop
- [ ] See also OneNote page "Studie Activity centric computation"
- [ ] Open windows and tabs
- [ ] When opening Explorer or a modal to choose a location to open or save something: start at a logical place for the activity instead of at the root
- [ ] Shareable with colleagues (not just share a screen, but share a session, with multiple mouse pointers and cursors)
