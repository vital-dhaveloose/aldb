# ALDB: tl;dr
ALDB stands for Activity-structured Linked Data and Blobs. It's a proposal for a data storage solution that:
- supports both structured (linked) data as well as blobs
- uses "activities" as the main structural paradigm (instead of re-modelling teams/projects/tasks/... as folders/lists/groups/... again and again in different places)

An activity is, conceptually, something one or more people spend time on. Things like a task, a conversation, a document, a project or even a department or a whole organisation. In ALDB these things are used to bring structure to all information, so structurally activities are containers for information. This information may take any form: symbolic (properties and attributes), sensory (images, sound, etc.) and other activities (thus making the structure multi-levelled). See [[1 Foundations]] for the core ideas of ALDB, including ar more detailed description of what an activity is and why it is a useful concept.

The goal of ALDB is to combine the best features of other solutions such as hierarchic file systems, app-specific unexposed data storage and structured data storage like relational databases. See also [[2 Other data storage solutions]].
